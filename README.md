# Introduction

This is a CSS Text Animation that uses keyframes for animation. When you first enter a website, if keyframes are not defined for 0% or 100% selectors, the text is sometimes displaced. To fix this a quick refresh is done. The same logic has been used here. You can see the text will be initially displaced, once you click on the button, the page will refresh and text will be in the center. There are different messages being diplayed every 3 seconds.
